Hello reader, 

This project was done in collaboration with students Thomas Syti and Ferdi Dogu for the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in the context of the second year course
INFO-H2001 - Programmation orientée objet - 202122 under the teaching of reknown searcher and professor Hughes Bersini. 

The goal of the project was to make a game with Object Oriented features seen in classes such as interfaces, encapsulation etc on Kotlin using Android Studio. The game we made 
is an innovative brick breaker where a platform is moved by the finger of the user to direct a ball that bounces around the space and that breaks the target bricks after touching
them a number of times while avoiding the ennemy balls that take one of its lives once they touch the ball. If the platform is moved below a certain limit, the ball stops and gets 
glued to it, allowing the user to then touch the part of the space where the ball will get thrown at from the platform, so as to make the game more versatile than just bouncing.
In addition, some bricks release bonuses or maluses which include increasing/decreasing the ball speed, giving or taking a life etc.
Three levels are to be completed to finish the game and at each level, the bricks become harder to break, the ennemy balls more numerous and the background theme and music are 
also given a fresh paint for immersion. The final result is shown in the "results" section. Enjoy !
